# 21st-Century Voting System

In order for democracy to survive, it must be defend by its citizens. Throughout the world reports of election irregularities and possible fraud are common. Even in the United States of America, looked upon by many nations as the shining beacon of democracy, reports of mishandling of ballots are common.

In the 21st century technology provides us with the tools to _secure_ elections. This project aims to build a 21st-century voting system that can provide [confidentiality, integrity and non-repudiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security#Basic_principles) to an election of any size. It will also provide the ability to securely vote via a mobile app, web browser, in-person or by mail.


## Goals for this project

- **Fully Transparent**:
  - Results will be verifiable and auditable by anyone with the necessary technical skills
  - Instructions on how to verify the results will always be publicly available
  - Each voter will be able to validate his or her vote was accurately recorded and counted
  - Source code will be open for all to inspect, audit and verify
  - All computer programs will be audited and penetration-tested

- **Available to All**: This system will be able to accept votes in a _cryptoraphically-secure_ manner from multiple sources, including:
  - Mobile apps
  - Web browsers
  - In-person voting systems
  - Mail-in and absentee ballots

- **Standards-Based**: The projects will use modern cryptographic and web standards for secure data communication.

- **Voter Confidentiality**: Nobody will be able to associate a person's name with their vote.

- **Verifiable Voter Identity**: Mobile app and in-person voters will be required to record a short video where they state their name as proof of identity.


## Status
This project is still in its infancy and needs to:

- Define and validate data flows and cryptographic rules to achieve its goals
- Set up a proper non-profit organization and accept donations (a project of the people, for he people)
- Begin software implementation and certification


## Adoption Challenges

Besides the technical and engineering efforts required to build this project, we face two colossal barriers to adoption:

1. Public mistrust of technology and election processes
2. Influence by corrupt politicians in government's election system selection process
